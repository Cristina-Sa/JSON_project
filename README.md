# JSON_project

This repository is a test of how to create JSON or XML files in order to collect information in a useful way. In this case what we are trying to collect are the catalogs of offers from different supermarkets near a home in order to save a few euros at the end of the month. 

The usefulness of these formats is that they serve to communicate information between a client and the server in a simple and structured way, being able to subsequently develop a web application that displays this information.

Therefore, the files contain shopping lists in the most detailed way possible, identifying each supermarket with its products, offers, period of validity, usual products of consumption without offer, units, unit of measure, price, etc., as well as marking whether the product has been purchased or not.

As for the information of the different supermarkets, some basic data are shown: name, address and geolocation, which will later allow the web application to provide additional functionalities.
